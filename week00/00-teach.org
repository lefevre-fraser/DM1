* TODO Play 
  Find 3-5 classmates and play \ldquo{}guess my number\rdquo. This is the game where one of
  you picks a number between 1 and 100, and the others try to guess it as
  quickly as possible. The only clues that can be given by the one who chose the
  number are \ldquo{}smaller\rdquo if the guessed number is too big, or \ldquo{}bigger\rdquo if the
  guessed number is too small.

  You will be reminded how to evaluate the following elisp code blocks. Please
  do so, and play =guess-my-number= by evaluating elisp code. Then write up your
  results --- what you did, and what you learned:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp :results silent
  (defun start ()
    (setq small 1
          big 100)
    (guess-my-number))

  (defun guess-my-number ()
     (/ (+ small big) 2))

  (defun smaller ()
    (setq big (- (guess-my-number) 1))
    (guess-my-number))

  (defun bigger ()
    (setq small (+ (guess-my-number) 1))
    (guess-my-number))
