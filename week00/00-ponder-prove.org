  This is the first of many exercises/problems/puzzles to come, always displayed
  in this type of yellow-background box.

  Propose a connection between discrete mathematics and the image above.
  (This is a \ldquo{}free association\rdquo exercise --- there is no right answer.)
#+end_note
#+begin_info
    Discrete math is confusing. I am also confused as to the point of this image.
    The path for completing Discrete Math is hard, or so I have heard. The desert
    can also be a very unforgiving place. But it can also be a place full of wonder
    and amazement.

  What English word has the smallest vowel-consonant-ratio (VCR)? For example,
  the VCRs of the words (including the TLA) in the previous sentence are 1/3,
  2/5, 1/3, 1/2, 1/2, 1/3, 2/3, 1/2, 3/2, and 0/3.

  In the figure below, the innermost circle has radius 1. It is circumscribed by
  an equilateral triangle, which is circumscribed by a circle, which is
  circumscribed by a square, which is circumscribed by yet another circle, and
  so forth.

  [[file:../img/circumscribed-polygons-and-circles.png][file:../img/circumscribed-polygons-and-circles.png]]

  What is the radius of the outermost circle?
#+end_note
#+begin_info

I created a progam in c++ for solving this problem.
The size of the outermost circle approaches the 
value 8.7
Wirh one billion loops the answer was 8.69918

:CODE:
#include <math.h>
#include <iostream>
#include <cassert>
double solve()
{
	double r1 = 1;
	double r2;
	for (long i = 3; i < 1000000000; ++i)
	{
		r2 = r1 / (cos(3.1415296 / i));
		r1 = r2;
	}

	assert(r1 == r2);
	return r1;
}

int main() 
{
	cout << solve() << endl;

  Pick a number (a positive integer). Form the product of that number, one more
  than that number, and one more than twice that number. Repeat for several
  different numbers. There is a pattern to these products. What is it?
#+end_note
*** Rephrase
    Take a number(3), one higher than it(4), and double it plus one(7)
    Multiply them together(84).
    Repeat with different numbers and find the pattern.
*** Approach
    1 * 2 * 3 = 6      /6   1
    2 * 3 * 5 = 30     /6   5
    3 * 4 * 7 = 84     /6   14
    4 * 5 * 9 = 180    /6   30
    5 * 6 * 11 = 330   /6   55
    6 * 7 * 13 = 546   /6   91
    7 * 8 * 15 = 840   /6   140
*** Solution
    These numbers are all divisable by 6
    and when dived by 6, they form the
    square pyramidal numbers.
*** Proof
    n * (n + 1) * ((2 * n) + 1)
    (n^2 + n) * (2n + 1)
    (2n^3 + 2n^2 + n^2 + n)
    (2n^3 + 3n^2 + n)

    This last part divided by 6 is the 
    equation for square pyramidal numbers.

   Numbers and words. Cycles and patterns.

   Do you think mathematicians discover or invent patterns? While pondering that
   question, consider what [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G._H._Hardy][G. H. Hardy]] famously wrote: /A mathematician, like a
   painter or a poet, is a maker of patterns. If his patterns are more permanent/
   /than theirs, it is because they are made with ideas/. What do you think he
   meant by that?

   Here\rsquo{}s a puzzle superficially just involving a 6-digit number and a 6-letter
   \ldquo{}word\rdquo. What does

   654321

   have to do with

   CLAHCK

   other than they both follow the \ldquo{}length 6\rdquo pattern?
#+end_note
*** Rephrase
    Are patterns by mathematicians discovered? or Invented?
    What is meant by G. H. Hardy's quote?
    What pattern exists between the numberset:
    654321
    and the set of letters:
    CLAHCK
*** Approaches
    CLAHCK sounds like 
    CLOCK
    Split the set of numbers in half
    654    321 

    CLAHCK sounds like 
    CLOCK
*** Solution
    If we look at the separated numbers it appears to
    be two times: 6:45 - 3:21
    the time elapsed is 8:27
    in between 8 and 27 are 18 numbers.

    split 18 and you get 
    the place number of the letters
    A and H 

    18 is the time between and
    AH are the letters changed
    in the middle of the word.

    so
    CLOCK 
    became
    CLAHCK

    Creating a patter is tuff stuff!
*** Proof
    Time was the correlation
    along with the place of the 
    letters in the alphabet
    and their place inside the word.

    Another example
    
    730158
    is to
    CLUCK

    CLUCK sounds like
    time

    difference in time is
    6:28
    there are 21 numbers in between
    and O is the 21st letter in the alphabet
    
    so our
    CLOCK
    maps to 
    CLUCK
