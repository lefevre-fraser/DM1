  [[file:../img/desert.jpg]]

  This is the first of many exercises/problems/puzzles to come, always displayed
  in this type of yellow-background box.

  Propose a connection between discrete mathematics and the image above.
  (This is a \ldquo{}free association\rdquo exercise --- there is no right answer.)
#+end_note
#+begin_info
    Discrete math is confusing. I am also confused as to the point of this image.
    The path for completing Discrete Math is hard, or so I have heard. The desert
    can also be a very unforgiving place. But it can also be a place full of wonder
    and amazement.

  the VCRs of the words (including the TLA) in the previous sentence are 1/3,
  2/5, 1/3, 1/2, 1/2, 1/3, 2/3, 1/2, 3/2, and 0/3.

  In the figure below, the innermost circle has radius 1. It is circumscribed by
  an equilateral triangle, which is circumscribed by a circle, which is
  circumscribed by a square, which is circumscribed by yet another circle, and
  so forth.

  Pick a number (a positive integer). Form the product of that number, one more
  than that number, and one more than twice that number. Repeat for several
  different numbers. There is a pattern to these products. What is it?
#+end_note
*** Rephrase
    Take a number(3), one higher than it(4), and double it plus one(7)
    Multiply them together(84).
    Repeat with different numbers and find the pattern.
*** Approach
    1 * 2 * 3 = 6      /6   1
    2 * 3 * 5 = 30     /6   5
    3 * 4 * 7 = 84     /6   14
    4 * 5 * 9 = 180    /6   30
    5 * 6 * 11 = 330   /6   55
    6 * 7 * 13 = 546   /6   91
    7 * 8 * 15 = 840   /6   140
*** Solution
    These numbers are all divisable by 6
*** Proof
    n * (n + 1) * ((2 * n) + 1)
    (n^2 + n) * (2n + 1)
            or
    (n + 1) * (2n^2 + n)

    (2n^3 + 2n^2 + n^2 + n)
    (2n^3 + 3n^2 + n)
    n * (2n^2 + 3n + 1)

   Numbers and words. Cycles and patterns.

   Do you think mathematicians discover or invent patterns? While pondering that
   question, consider what [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G._H._Hardy][G. H. Hardy]] famously wrote: /A mathematician, like a
   painter or a poet, is a maker of patterns. If his patterns are more permanent/
   /than theirs, it is because they are made with ideas/. What do you think he
   meant by that?

   Here\rsquo{}s a puzzle superficially just involving a 6-digit number and a 6-letter
   \ldquo{}word\rdquo. What does

   654321

   have to do with

   CLAHCK

   other than they both follow the \ldquo{}length 6\rdquo pattern?
#+end_note
*** Rephrase
    Are patterns by mathematicians discovered? or Invented?
    What is meant by G. H. Hardy's quote?
    What pattern exists between the numberset:
    654321
    and the set of letters:
    CLAHCK
