* TODO Read Subsection DEF through subsubsection DEU from [[https://rickneff.github.io/metaphors-be-with-you.html][The Book]].
* TODO Answer What is True
   Check the box if you can truthfully assert that you did any of the following:
  - [ ] I reviewed my solution to last week\rsquo{}s /census-taker problem/.
  - [ ] I identified the \ldquo{}key move\rdquo required to see the answer, and came
    prepared to articulate it if called upon.
  - [ ] I found two or three classmates (the same as last week, or different
    ones) to form a team for an in-class exercise.
  - [ ] I encouraged them to be to class early so as to have time to set up two
    tables and sit facing each other.
