* TODO Think and Discuss
  Think about and come prepared to discuss with your group (old or new) how to
  compute the probability that a verse randomly chosen from the verses in the
  Book of Mormon that contain the words =w1= and =w2= in close proximity will
  have those two words in alphabetical order.

  What the words =w1= and =w2= are will be revealed in class.
