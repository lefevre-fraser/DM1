* TODO Read DEV through DEW from [[https://rickneff.github.io/metaphors-be-with-you.html][The Book]].

* TODO Answer What is True about Why Teach Logic?
  If you can truthfully assert any of the following, you know what to do:

  - [ ] I know why \ldquo{}It depends\rdquo is the correct answer to the question: True or
    False? Zero is a member of the set of *Natural* numbers.
  - [ ] I know that statements saying such-and-such elements are members of
    so-and-so sets are *propositions*.
  - [ ] I know that \ldquo{}Whatever is written by a famous person is true\rdquo is called
    the \ldquo{}Appeal to Authority\rdquo fallacy.
  - [ ] I know that \ldquo{}Whatever is believed by a large number of people is true\rdquo
    is called the \ldquo{}Bandwagon\rdquo fallacy.
  - [ ] I know the difference between a /valid/ argument and a /sound/
    argument.
  - [ ] I know why it is *false* to say that Zeezrom tried to fool Alma and
    Amulek with a /Hasty Generalization/ argument.
  - [ ] I know that to study something out in oneâ€™s mind requires more than
    just gathering facts; it requires reasoning out the logical relationships
    among the facts.
  - [ ] I know who said: \ldquo{}The mind should be trained to study, to reflection,
    to system [...] [This mental labor will] yield fruits satisfactory to
    itself, and useful in the salvation of others.\rdquo
  - [ ] I know that the proud despise reason because it destroys their craft.
  - [ ] I know who said \ldquo{}We are free to think [,plan and do]. But once an
    action has been taken, we are never free from its consequences.\rdquo
  - [ ] I know that logic, like language, must be studied and understood in
    order to be used effectively.
* TODO Answer What is True about your ICE Preparation
   Note: ICE = In-Class Exercise.

   Check the box if you can truthfully assert that you did any of the following:
  - [ ] I reviewed my solution to last week\rsquo{}s /census-taker problem/.
  - [ ] I identified the \ldquo{}key move\rdquo required to see the answer, and came
    prepared to articulate it if called upon.
  - [ ] I found two or three classmates (the same as last week, or different
    ones) to form a team for an ICE (to be revealed on Day 2).
  - [ ] I started discussing with my team how to compare/contrast terms as
    warmup for the ICE on Day 2. For example, compare and contrast pairs of the
    four terms
    1. immortality
    2. salvation
    3. eternal life
    4. exaltation
    taking the pairs across the two rows (e.g., immortality versus salvation) or
    down the two columns (e.g. immortality versus eternal life) of the following
    table, where the column headings give a hint:
    | Moses 1:39   | Nouns meaning "the action of (a verb)" or "the result of (a verb)" |
    |--------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------|
    | immortality  | salvation                                                          |
    | eternal life | exaltation                                                         |
