* TODO Answer What is True By Way of Review
   You know what to do:
  - [ ] I know what a CSF is.
  - [ ] I know what \ldquo{}congruence modulo a positive integer\rdquo means.
  - [ ] I know how to find by inspection MMIs (modular multiplicative inverses)
    of small positive integers modulo other small positive integers.
  - [ ] I know how the Euclidean GCD algorithm works.
  - [ ] I know how the Extended Euclidean GCD algorithm works.

* TODO Read section THR subsections STU through STD from [[https://rickneff.github.io][The Book]].
* TODO Answer What is True
  You know what to do:
  - [ ] I know that a rooted tree is a tree in which one of the nodes is
    designated as the root.
  - [ ] I know that in a rooted tree, every link can be viewed as directed away
    from the root.
  - [ ] I know that in a rooted tree, the parent of a (non-root) node *n* is the
    unique node that has a directed link to *n*.
  - [ ] I know why it is *false* to say that every node in a rooted tree has a
    parent.
  - [ ] I know that a child of a node *n* is any node of which *n* is the
    parent.
  - [ ] I know that a leaf is a childless node.
  - [ ] I know that using \ldquo{}leaf\rdquo and \ldquo{}child(less)\rdquo in the same thought is using
    a mixed metaphor.
  - [ ] I know that the level of a node is its distance from the root, measured
    as the number of links in the path from root to node.
  - [ ] I know why it is *false* to say that a tree is *m*-ary if each node has
    at least *m* children.
  - [ ] I know why in a rooted binary tree with 16 nodes, there must be a path
    of length 4.
  - [ ] I know in what sense there are only two *different* unrooted trees with
    four unlabeled nodes.
  - [ ] I know in what sense there are only four different *rooted* trees with
    four unlabeled nodes.
