* TODO Read PQR through PQX from [[https://rickneff.github.io/metaphors-be-with-you.html][The Book]].
* TODO Answer What is True By Way of Review (and Preview)
   You know what to do.
  - [ ] I know that a prime is an integer greater than 1 that is divisible only
    by 1 and itself.
  - [ ] I know that a prime is an integer greater than 1 that has exactly two
    factors.
  - [ ] I know that a composite is an integer greater than 1 that has three or
    more factors.
  - [ ] I know that the number 1 is the loneliest number --- it is neither prime
    nor composite.
  - [ ] I know that every integer greater than 1 can be written uniquely as a
    prime or as the product of two or more primes where the prime factors are
    written in order of nondecreasing size.
  - [ ] I know what the theorem mentioned in the previous assertion is called.
  - [ ] I know why it is that if n is a composite integer, then n has a prime
    divisor less than or equal to \radic{}n.
  - [ ] I know why it is *false* to say that the product of any two primes is
    odd.
  - [ ] I know how big or how to find out how big the largest known prime is
    (big as in how many decimal digits it has).
  - [ ] I know how ENT meets up with the methods of continuous mathematics
    (e.g., calculus) in the statement of the PNT.
  - [ ] I know what the TLAs ENT and PNT expand to.
  - [ ] I know how to compute the GCD and the LCM of two numbers.
  - [ ] I know what the TLAs GCD and LCM expand to.
  - [ ] I know how to create an efficient =is-prime= predicate (at least up to
    the prime 179424673) given a vector containing the first ten million primes.
  - [ ] I am ready to learn how the RSA cryptosystem works.
  - [ ] I am ready to learn why the RSA cryptosystem works.
* TODO Read About Creativity
  [[https://firstthreeodds.org/17657741833134731255/creativity.html][This excerpt]] from Steve Olson\rsquo{}s book that you first encountered (a different
  excerpt from) in [[file:../week05/05-prepare.org][Week 05]] has some bearing on your last week\rsquo{}s *Teach*
  activity. Ponder what the connection is, and prepare to write what you think
  it is.
* TODO Answer What is True
   You know what to do.
  - [ ] I discovered that the formidable-looking problem that opened the second
    day of the 42^{nd} International Mathematical Olympiad is the same problem as
    the one in FDK, which was part of last week\rsquo{}s Ponder/Prove, and was
    optional.
  - [ ] I discovered that a way to think about creativity is to compare it to
    biological evolution.
  - [ ] I thought about how \ldquo{}[my] mind takes apart old ideas and observations and
    juxtaposes their elements in new ways.\rdquo
  - [ ] I know what word goes in the blank: \ldquo{}What keeps a lot of people from
    being creative is that they are too _________. \rdquo
  - [ ] I know what my personal selection process looks like, as in: \ldquo{}With so
    many ways of combining things, creators cannot consider every possibility.
    They must go through a selection process by which they first consider the
    most promising options.\rdquo
