* Catalog Description
  What this course is about: /Mathematics for computer science./

  This course introduces the mathematical topics needed to provide a solid
  theoretical foundation for computer science. The following topics will be
  /lightly/ covered:

  - Sets and Logic
  - Functions and Relations
  - Combinatorics and Probability
  - Number Theory and Practice
  - Trees and Graphs
  - Languages and Grammars

* Objectives
  1. Know the basic terminology and operations of sets and logic, functions and
     relations, combinatorics and probability, number theory and practice, trees
     and graphs, and languages and grammars.
  2. Demonstrate logical reasoning through solving problems.
  3. Interpret the meaning of mathematical statements in the context of
     real-world applications.
  4. Think like a mathematician by making good connections.
  5. Learn basic functional programming by way of elisp, reading and writing
     elisp code.

* Prerequisite
  You must have successfully completed the following course:

  - CS 165 Object-Oriented Software Development

* Required Text
   [[https://rickneff.github.io/metaphors-be-with-you.html][/Metaphors Be With You: A Tireless Work on Play on Words/]]

   *Online only --- no print edition.*
* Requirements
  You are required to...

  - attend class, as attendance and participation factor heavily into your
    grade.
  - read assigned portions of the course materials *before* the class meeting
    when they will be discussed.
  - take \ldquo{}prepare\rdquo before-class or in-class quizzes.
  - do \ldquo{}teach one another\rdquo in-class exercises.
  - do weekly \ldquo{}ponder and prove\rdquo assignments to deepen your understanding of
    selected topics.

* Assessments
  There will be weekly \ldquo{}preparation assessment\rdquo quizzes that you will take
  before or during class. These will be on any current or previously discussed
  course content, to encourage steady knowledge accumulation and retention.

  In-class exercises are described below, but the importance of the \ldquo{}teach one
  another\rdquo component cannot be overstated. This is one reason attendance is
  mandatory.

* Assignments
  Homework assignments are of three types: Exercises, Problems, and Puzzles.
** Exercises
   Exercises are individual and group learning activities that will require
   either a small amount of preparation before class, or participation during
   class, or both. Although time will be given during class, some time outside
   of class may also be required.

** Problems
   Problems are weightier, more challenging assignments that invite you to
   explore in more depth certain topics in discrete mathematics, as well as
   increase your lisp/functional programming prowess.

** Puzzles
   Puzzles are like problems, only with another added measure of difficulty that
   will require even more ingenuity, deep thought and persistent effort to
   solve. Think \ldquo{}Puzzle Room\rdquo --- where you must solve a problem in order to
   escape from a room. But the hints are more obscure, and in fact the statement
   of the problem may be obscure, indirect or encoded somehow.

* Grading
** Grade Category Weighting
   - Prepare and Teach Exercises+: 30%
     - This includes Attendance and Participation.
     - Each unexcused absence will incur a 5% penalty. If you are absent six
       times you will fail the class.
     - If you are tardy (which means coming in after the prayer has begun) three
       times, that counts as one absence.
     - You must bring a laptop or other Internet-connectable (and tools-ready)
       device to each class meeting.
   - Ponder and Prove Assignments: 70%

** Grade Calculating
  Your weighted percentage will determine your final grade in a reasonably
  standard way, as computed in the [[file:gradebook.org][gradebook.org]] file.

** Late Policy
  Work is due as stated in [[file:schedule.org][the schedule]]. Late work is accepted *only if* the
  reason is extraordinary, and acceptance is reached through private and
  prolonged negotiation. And you must come talk to me in person --- NOT by
  email, nor any other means of communication.
