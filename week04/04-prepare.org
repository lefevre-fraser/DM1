* TODO Read Subsection GHI through subsubsection GHS from [[https://rickneff.github.io/metaphors-be-with-you.html][The Book]].
* TODO Answer What is True By Way of Review
   If you can truthfully assert any of the following, you know what to do:
  - [ ] I know that mathematical functions are useful abstractions of the
    process of transformation.
  - [ ] I also know *why* mathematical functions are useful abstractions of the
    process of transformation.
  - [ ] I know that *onto* functions are also called *surjective* functions.
  - [ ] I know that *one-to-one* functions are also called *injective*
    functions.
  - [ ] I know that in lisp there are no restrictions on what objects can be the
    inputs to a function (what it takes) and what objects can be the outputs of
    a function (what it gives).
  - [ ] I know how many inputs a *k-ary* function has.
  - [ ] I know that in formulas, variables can be /free/ or /bound/, but not
    both, and not neither.
  - [ ] I know why it is *false* to say that predicates take only boolean
    variables as arguments.
  - [ ] I know why it is *false* to say that quantifiers can *always* be
    modeled as loops.
* TODO Answer What is True
  You know what to do:
  - [ ] I pondered last week\rsquo{}s compare/contrast exercises, both code and gospel
    terms.
  - [ ] For the code, I compared/contrasted my group\rsquo{}s summary to the summary in
    the key.
  - [ ] For the gospel terms, I thought about the ramifications of taking
    scriptures out of context.
  - [ ] I thought about how to answer a critic of the Church who claims the
    Doctrine and Covenants contradicts itself in what it names the greatest gift
    of God in section 6 verse 13 and section 14 verse 7.
