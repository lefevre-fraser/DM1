  Write elisp code that takes two same-sized vectors of one-character symbols
  and \ldquo{}shuffles\rdquo them together into one vector. For example:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp prepend
  (shuffle [A B C] [x y z])
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: [A x B y C z]

  The challenge? Do it without using loops!

** Hint
  It can be done with one line of code in the body of the =shuffle= defun. This
  one line of code uses four functions, two of which take another function as an
  argument, the other two being those argument functions. The names of these
  four functions will be revealed during class.

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (defun shuffle (v1 v2)
    (apply 'vconcat (mapcar* 'vector v1 v2)))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: shuffle

  In subsubsection GHS Roger Penrose is quoted. Discuss this quote with your
  neighbors (teams, groups, same as before or different), focusing on how he
  relates awareness, understanding and intelligence. Then consider the
  following:

  In Doctrine and Covenants section 93 the Lord defines some words. In
  particular, Doctrine and Covenants 93:24 defines truth as /knowledge
  of things as they are, and as they were, and as they are to come./
  Later, verse 29 equates /intelligence/ with /the light of truth/.
  Even later, in verse 36, appears the familiar saying /The glory of
  God is intelligence, or, in other words, light and truth/.

  From these marvelous revealed words, and /thinking in terms of sets/, we can
  conclude which of the following?

  - [X] Intelligence is the intersection of light and truth.
  - [ ] Intelligence is the union of light and truth.
  - [ ] Intelligence is a subset of truth, and light is the name of that subset.
  - [ ] Intelligence, light and truth are all synonymous.

  Starting with the the first Idea:
    Truth is Knowledge of things as they are.
  From this we can say:
    Truth is Knowledge of things,
    not things themselves.
    Light is a thing.
    Light has knowledge about its self.
    Truth, being knowledge about things,
    has knowlegde about light, but not light itself.

  So we can think of this as a venn diagram:
  [[file:../img/TruthLight.png]]

  Now, to address the other two statements.
  - Intelligence is truth and light. 
  - Intelligence is the light of truth.

  These statements might seem to say different
  things, but taking a closer look at it, I feel
  like they are actually tring to say the dame thing.

  Intelligence is truth and light:
  - In coding when we want to find the Intersection of two
    things we use the and symbol '&&'. So aplying this
    to the phrase above we can read it to be:
      Intelligence is the intersection of truth and light.
    This coincides with our ideas from the previous paragraphs.

  Next,
  Intelligence is the light of truth:
  - This is a little harder to think about. But when 
    we read it like this it makes more sense.
      Intelligence is the part of truth that is light.

  Again, we see through looking at the verse in a 
  different way, not changin the meaning, we are able
  to see how it says, "Intelligence is the intersection
  of light and truth"
