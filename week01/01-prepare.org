* TODO Answer What is True
   Check the box if you can truthfully assert any of the following:
  - [ ] I know from my previous reading why it is *false* to say that languages
    and grammars belong to English and have nothing to do with discrete math.
  - [ ] I know why Brother Neff likes the English alphabet with its 26 letters.
  - [ ] I know the meaning of these seven words: =first three odds double halve
    divide reciprocate=.
  - [ ] I could correctly answer one of the following three questions if called
    upon in class:
    1. What is the difference between *using* a word and *mentioning* it?
    2. What does *TLA ISA* mean?
    3. What is a *tetragramamalgam*?
