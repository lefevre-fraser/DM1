  Welcome to Discrete Mathematics One!

  There are many, many things you can do in emacs/Spacemacs/org-mode that you
  will learn in this course. One of them is that links in this file can be
  visited either in the usual way by clicking on them, or else by positioning
  the cursor on them and pressing Enter.

  In case you're new to them, since .org files are "plain old text" files
  (marked up in clever ways), any old editor will allow you to view and edit
  them. But org-mode can only be used to full advantage within emacs.
